# python geospatial project


This project is in progress.

The goal is to create a tool to automate one or two tasks for mapping geospatial data, to apply one geoproccess to the data, and to create a map plot. The result will be a tool to automate some of this process and an adaptable code set for future projects. 

**Tasks**

1: Write function to load a group of shapefiles from subfolders in one main directory into python as geodataframes.

2: Project CRS
- write a function to check that all shapefiles are in the same CRS
- and to update CRS of any that aren't
	
3: clip data 
- use study area polygon or other boundary to clip data
- create class in data for styling 

4: create plot with options for styling 
- set bounding box
- style data 
	- categorical 
	- quantitative 
- color
- font size
- title
- annotation
- axis display
- legend

5: export plots to pdf or svg format for editing in Illustrator

	
**Process:** 

A. organize data

B. write code to create maps with Hudson Estuary Water Quality data (from HEP project)

C. test adaptability of code with some other data (estuary datasets or California landslide, fire and sample point data)
