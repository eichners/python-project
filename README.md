# python-project


This project is in progress.

The goal of this python project is to create a tool to automate one or two tasks for mapping geospatial data and creating map plots and to create an adaptable code set for multiple geospatial projects. 

**Tasks**

1: Load a group of shapefiles from subfolders one main directory into python as geodataframes.

2: Project CRS
- check that all shapefiles are in the same CRS
- update the ones that aren't into the project CRS
	
3: clip data to study area
- use study area polygon or other boundary set to clip data

4: create plot with options for styling 
- set bounding box
- style data 
	- categorical 
	- quantitative 
- color
- font size
- title
- annotation
- axis display
- legend

5: export plots to pdf or svg format for editing in Illustrator

	
**Process:** 

A. write code to create maps with Hudson Estuary Water Quality data (from HEP project)
B. test adaptability of code with California landslide, fire and sample point data
