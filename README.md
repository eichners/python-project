# python-project


This project is in progress.

The goal of this python project is to create a tool to automate one or two tasks for mapping geospatial data and creating map plots and to create an adaptable code set for multiple geospatial projects. 

**Tasks**
task 1: Load a group of shapefiles from subfolders one main directory into python as geodataframes.

task 2: Project CRS
	- check that all shapefiles are in the same CRS
	- update the ones that aren't into the project CRS

task 3: clip data to study area
	- use study area polygon or other boundary set to clip data

task 4: create plot with options for styling 
	- set bounding box
	- style data 
		- categorical 
		- quantitative 
	- color
	- font size
	- title
	- annotation
	- axis display
	- legend

task 5: export plots to pdf or svg format for editing in Illustrator
	
**Process:** 
A. write code to create maps with Hudson Estuary Water Quality data (from HEP project)
B. test adaptability of code with California landslide, fire and sample point data
